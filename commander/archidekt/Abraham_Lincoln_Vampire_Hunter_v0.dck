Name=Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter
Description={"ops":[{"insert":"This deck will focus on the ending action scene of the movie \"Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter.\"\n\n\nSPOILERS (really, it's all spoilers):\n\nIn this final action scene, the four main characters of the movie attempt to protect a train delivering silver to the army front at Gettysburg. The knowledge of this delivery is betrayed to the vampire enemy, who attack the train.\n\nAt the end of the scene, it is discovered the train is filled with rock, the betrayal was a trap, and the silver has been successfully moved on the other prominent railroad in the movie, the underground railroad.\n\nA challenge with this deck design will be giving respect to the time period this movie occurs with the subject of the civil war. Magic does not have strong representation in it's history of cards for black individuals. I want to respect representation here for the prominent roles many of these individuals had in history, and give respect for the roles I also felt they should have in the movie.\n\nWith this, some of the cards where chosen for the keywords, types, or mana color. Other cards may be chosen for art where I can.\n\n\nTHE CHARACTERS (protagonists of the train fight):\n\nAbraham Lincoln / Wernog, Rider's Chaplain : The main character of the movie should be the leader of the deck. I've chosen Wernog, Rider's Chaplain to represent this character. This features the qualities of being black and white as a character, with high morals, but dark sides. Also, this legendary human investigates, showing an interest in learning. Finally, the Friends Forever keyword represents that through out the movie, Abraham Lincoln cares deeply for his friend Will Johnson and his plight.\nRelated cards for this character (by card name): Solemnity, Confront the Past, Smite the Monstrous\n\nWill Johnson / Elmar, Ulvenwald Informant : Will Johnson is sometimes a background character though much of the movie, but is also a life long friend and driving force of many of the main events in Abraham Lincoln's life. Will Johnson support's Abraham Lincoln's choices and fights alongside in the final scene. I've chosen Elmar, Ulvenwald Informant for this character. I wanted this character to also have the Friends Forever keyword due to his role in the movie. The investigation ability gives this pair a common theme. This was a difficult character to fit due to the limited Friends Forever options.\nRelated cards for this character (by card name): True Conviction, Shoulder to Shoulder\n\nHenry Sturges / Sengir, the Dark Baron : Henry Sturges is the vampire mentor who trains Abraham Lincoln in fighting vampires. He is not necessarily a friend, but a partner in the war. I've chosen Sengir, the Dark Baron for this character because he is a vampire, a partner keyword, and a noble.\nRelated cards for this character (by card name): Spiteful Blow, Cruel Reality, Impeccable Timing\n\nJoshua Speed / Djeru, With Eyes Open : Joshua Speed is the betrayer who sets the trap. His role is a supporting character until this moment. I'm choosing Djeru, With Eyes Open for this role due the abilities to pull a planeswalker (the antagonist) from the deck into the trap.\nRelated cards for this character (by card name): Act of Treason, Lure\n\n\nTHE CHARACTERS (protagonists of the underground railroad):\n\nHarriet Tubman / Subira, Tulzidi Caravanner : Historical leader figure of the underground railroad, she is shown escorting Mary Todd Lincoln and assisting in the delivery of the silver. Subira, Tulzidi Caravanner will represent Harriet Tubman. Her abilities allow movement across lands and to effectivily 'resupply troops' (draw cards).\nRelated cards for this character (by card name): Resupply\n\nMary Todd Lincoln / Michiko Konda, Truth Seeker : Abraham Lincoln's wife. After a bonding scene between the two, she is entrusted with delivering the silver using the underground railroad. I chose Michiko Konda, Truth Seeker for Mary Todd Lincoln. She looks like a strong woman who is willing to go on a journey for the sake of others. Her ability can be a silver bullet against attackers.\nRelated cards for this character (by card name): Silverstrike\n\n\nTHE CHARACTERS (antagonists of the train fight):\n\nAdam / Sorin, Imperious Bloodlord: The oldest vampire, leader and progenitor of all other vampires, and the only antagonist left for this scene. He is finally defeated in this last action scene. I chose Sorin, Imperious Bloodlord for a few reasons. The obvious ones being he is an old vampire and a planeswalker for the most powerful way a character can be shown. Being a planeswalker is important to the interaction of the deck with Djeru. Also, artwise, this card is a decent fit. Finally, his abilities allow him to deploy and direct his vampires.\nRelated cards for this character (by card name):  Curse of Thirst, Show of Confidence\n\n\nTHE CHARACTERS (antagonists of the underground railroad):\n\nVadoma / Olivia, Mobilized for War : Vadoma is a minion of Adam. She does missions for him when he is busy elsewhere. She doesn't have any character development outside this. This is the female antagonist, she is killed in the final fight scene on the underground railroad half by Mary Todd Lincoln. She has a brief appearance as well in the train fight scene to light the bridge on fire. Olivia, Mobilized for War is representing this character. This version of Olivia seems less like a leader and more like a general that can be commanded.\nRelated cards for this character (by art): Devastate\n\nThe TRAIN BRIDGE battle scene:\n\nIn this scene part, the male protagonists battle the remaining male antagonist. There are some pieces needed to set this scene and some critical props.\n\nTRAIN and BRIDGE: The Aradara Express will be the train for this scene. Artistically, it is the closest looking. The Rustvale Bridge is the nicest looking train bridge I could find to lit on fire.\n\nPROPS: The axe is the main weapon of Abraham Lincoln and a pair of knives for Will Johnson. (I would have pistols for Will Johnson, but Magic doesn't have pistols. He throws some knives during the scene, so those will need to work.) These are the two main fighters in the scene. The Heavy Mattock is the best art for the specific axe (a farm axe) and gives +2 power when wielded (enough to kill most vampires).\n\nAt the end, Adam is killed using the silver pocket watch. Quicksilver Amulet will fill this spot. It is the closest artistically.\n\nVAMPIRE EXTRAS: To be an extra, these vampires, look the part in the art and have a toughness that can be killed by an axe blow (2 or less). These are all common and uncommon vampires who only purpose is to die in this scene for a good fight.\n\nSCENE BACKGROUND: The train travels thru rocky terrain until it reaches this spanning bridge. I've chosen Mountains, some Forests, and any lands looking rocky, wild, or having high combat energy to set the scene.\n\nThe UNDERGROUND RAILROAD delivery scene:\n\nThis scene is split in two parts wrapping the train battle. First is shown Harriet Tubman leading Mary Todd Lincoln thru a field of wheat (or tall grasses). This scene closes revealing 100s of others working on this delivery all carrying goods by hand.\nThe second half of this scene happens after the train battle. The long line of workers has delivered the silver to the front lines where Harriet Tubman and Mary Todd Lincoln sort the goods for the soldier stations.\n\nSILVER: All kinds of silver anything was gathered up and made into weaponry. I've added any cards I could find with silver to deliver.\n\nUNDERGROUND WORKERS: Predominantly this movie uses black folks doing the work in this scene due to the historical significance of the underground railroad. The cards chosen here must feature black people in the art (respectfully). As with the vampire extras, these are also all commons or uncommons.\n\nFINAL NOTES:\nThe best dressed extra in this list is Creeping Bloodsucker. If I had been doing some of the opening scenes of this movie instead of the final, this card art could alone be the scene where Bart kills Abraham Lincoln's mother. At the end of movie, Bart is already killed, so this card only gets the best dressed extra award.\n"}]}
