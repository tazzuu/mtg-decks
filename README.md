# Magic the Gathering Deck lists

These deck lists were automatically exported with [`mtgconv`](https://github.com/tazzuu/mtgconv).

The .dck format files are designed for import into [Card Forge](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge) for playtesting.

> 
> cardPicsDir is defined as <\cacheDir>/pics/cards/ by default. If you wish to use a non-default directory, please see the forge.profile.preferences.example file located in the Forge installation directory root. You can use this file to, for example, share the card pics directory with another program, such as Magic Workstation.
